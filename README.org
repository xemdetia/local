* xemdetia's emacs local configuration

  This is a personal configuration file focusing on consistency
  between Linux and Windows as platforms.

  I am not expecting contributors at any level. This is more an
  example project for other people to enhance their things.
* Install

  1. =cd ~/.emacs.d/=
  2. =git clone https://github.com/xemdetia/local.git=
  3. Edit your =.emacs= to include the following:

     #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
       (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/local")
       (require 'local-init)
     #+END_SRC
* Notes

  - If do not have a =init_cmdproxy.exe.sh= file, it will copy one
    into =~/.emacs.d=.
